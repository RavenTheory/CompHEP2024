This folder contains all of the source code and also the setting file for the source codes.

The settings.txt file in this directory is necessary to run the programs and by modifying the settings.txt you can change which files to analyse or how many events to simulate.
The default amount of events to simulate is set at 1000 so it is advised to increase it for actual simulation.
In the settings.txt file the lines starting with # are ignored.

The normalization coefficient depends on the amount of simulations ran with the following equation:
Normalization_coefficient = sigma_of_process * Integrated_Luminosity / Number_of_events_simulated
here sigma_of_process is the cross section one gets from simulation at the end (PYTHIA Event and Cross Section Statistics, use the summed cross section).
The Integrated_Luminosity is the integrated luminosity of the experiment we are trying to replicate.
In the default analysis of which result is in the run file, we have used value of 300 fb^{-1}.

It is adviced to look at settings.txt and understand how it works for the best user experience.
Note that most of the filenames that are given in settings.txt don't need .root specification since the program adds them inside the program.

It is also adviced to check the Drell_Yan_generator before running the simulation.
This is because the Drell-Yan generator can etiher generate whole Drell-Yan process or just the muons from Drell-Yan (this wouldn't give the correct normalization by itself).


The commands to run to start simulation (you first have to change the pythia path to the correct directory in the makefile) are the following:

make Higgs_event_generator
./Higgs_event_generator.exe

make Drell_Yan_generator
./Drell_Yan_generator.exe

make ttbar_generator
./ttbar_generator.exe

To start the data processing and analysis you have to run
make data_combiner
./data_combiner.exe

make muon_data_smearer
./muon_data_smearer.exe

make reconstruction
./reconstruction.exe

make analysis
./analysis.exe


To do analysis with the pT cut:
make pt_cut_analysis
./pt_cut_analysis.exe


The current version simulations don't give data files that need to be fixed, but for old data that needed to be fixed the following command is useful:
make repair_muon_data
./repair_muon_data.exe


To read or inspect the data you can use the following commands (depending on if the data has been smeared or not):
make muon_reader
./muon_reader.exe

make smeared_muon_reader
./smeared_muon_reader.exe
