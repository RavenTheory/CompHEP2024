THIS MAKE FILE ASSUMES THAT THE NAME OF LIBRARY SOURCE CODE IS measurement.cpp AND THE NAME OF A PROGRAM THAT USES THE LIBRARY IS main.cpp.
A header file (with .h extension) is also needed.

The libary code/definition is in measurement.cpp. The make command compiles it into library and also compiles main.cpp that uses the library.
    -> The final result of the make is getting the executable named a.out.

Make clean removes all of the compiled files including the library that has the extension .a
