We have both problems of Exercise 5 as a function in the file p1.cxx in this folder, since it is easier to make the makefile this way (won't need to create rootified classes and stuff).

I have included the example histogram that I got from running the programs myself but not the data used to create it.
The data is not included, but the runnin the executable that we get from using make command will generate it.

make command will compile the program into executable named "p1". By executing this with command "./p1" will generate the root file with data and a histogram in a pdf. 
By default histogram is saved in a pdf file, but it can be changed in the function p2().
