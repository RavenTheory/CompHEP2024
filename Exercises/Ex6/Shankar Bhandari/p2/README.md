In this folder are p1.py and p2.py which are pyroot version of the promlems 1 and 2 of exercise 5.
You can execute them via following command: 
"pyroot p1.py" and 
"pyroot p2.py"

For complicated reasons using python3 command instead pf pyroot to run the files doesn't work for me, but it might work for you so you can try that too.

The resulting histogram is presented in pdf but the root file with data isn't included. You can generate the new data file with running the p1.py program.
