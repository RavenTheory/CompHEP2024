The problem one is done with c++ file with name p1.cpp and the scrips have following name:

a) bashscript has name jobscript.sh

b) python jobscript has name jobscript.py

The problem one also has make file associated with it (will compile c++ code) make clean will remove the .out file and all the .txt files in the folders (.txt is the output of our jobscripts).


The problem 2 is done with python file name p2.py

This program is run in a standard way via terminal: python3 p2.py
